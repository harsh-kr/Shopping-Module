# Shopping-Module
:moneybag: :credit_card: The shopping module is a very basic program in Python that I made in 1st year of my college.
It consists of two modules, Admin module in which only the admin(with the correct password) can add products for display, edit the prices of the existing products, delete the existing products etc.
The other module, Customer module allows the customer to view the products in stock, add the products to the basket, view and edit the basket and finally see the amount to be paid in the bill.
